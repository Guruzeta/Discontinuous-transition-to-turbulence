# Discontinuous-transition-to-turbulence


This is a compilation of  codes, data, input files, output files and instructions for our paper titled "Tricritical directed percolation controls the laminar-turbulent transition in pipes with body forces".  This is intended to aid a reader in reproducing results mentioned in the paper. 

## How to navigate this repository
For learning about the source code, output files and plots

- for the case of tricritical DP without space (i.e. Fig 2 of the paper), check the file titled "tricritical_DP_no_space_plotting_script.ipynb". In that python notebook (Github in-browser viewable), a summary of the numerical procedure along with output file references and plots can be found.

- for the case of tricritical DP with space (i.e. Fig 3 of the paper), check the file titled "tricritical_DP_space_plotting_script.ipynb". In that python notebook (Github in-browser viewable), a summary of the numerical procedure along with output file references and plots can be found.

- for the plot of relaminarization, check the mathematica notebook titled "TDP_with_space-turbulent fraction_at_different_distances.nb". The mathematica notebook can downloaded and run to produce the output for Figure in Supplementary material of our paper.
